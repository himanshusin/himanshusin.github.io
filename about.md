I'm Himanshu and I'm a data scientist with [Infogix Inc.](http://infogix.com) currently working on projects that are aimed to  reduce customer fraud, reduce churn, detect anomaly , and identify best customer to be onboarded in telcom orders and insurance claims .

I use machine learning to solve business problem and I enjoy playing around with data of all sorts. It's amazing to me what can be learned from analyzing, visualizing, making prediction with data!

I am using R every day at work and the thematic scope there is of course analytics centric with a lot of experimentation of Machine Learning and statistics. I wanted to have an write-up to regularly proliferate some fragment of my work that I normally deal with. I have very often benefited from other people's published code. It has infused ideas for my own work and I hope that sharing my own analyses will inspire others. 

My tool of choice for data analysis so far has been **R** (and sometime SAS and Python too).

I am also creating a R package that is aimed to simulate activity_cost for a set of actions, leveraging optim(),arules() and ggplot2(). Once ready , it is expected to be helpful to propose **"NEXT BEST ACTION"**  and ventures into **"PRESCRIPTIVE ANALYTICS"**. I hope I'll make it available via CRAN and Github, very soon.

I keep myself up to date regularly on the latest developments in the field of data science by taking up MOOCS/Certifications and competing in Kaggle.

This blog will showcase some of the analyses I have been doing with different data sets (all freely available), sometime for my projects and sometime for fun. I will also host materials for learners.
