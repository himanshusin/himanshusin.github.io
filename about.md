**Welcome to my page!**

I'm Himanshu and I'm a data scientist with [Infogix Inc.](http://infogix.com) currently working on projects that are aimed to  reduce customer fraud, reduce churn, detect anomaly , and identify best customer to be onboarded. I majorly work with telcom orders and insurance claims data.

I use machine learning to solve business problem and I enjoy playing around with data of all sorts. 

It's amazing to me what can be learned from analyzing, visualizing, making prediction with data!

I am using R every day at work and the thematic scope there is of course analytics centric with a lot of experimentation of machine learning and statistics. 

I have very often benefited from other people's published work and and it has infused ideas for sharing some portion of my  work, thus these **blogs**. 

I hope that sharing my own analyses will help others. 

My tool of choice for data analysis so far has been **R** and **Python** .

I try and keep myself up to date by taking up MOOCS/Certifications and competing in Kaggle.

This blog will showcase some of the analyses I have been doing with different data sets (all freely available), sometime for my projects and sometime for fun. I will also host materials for learners.

Keep in touch !!
